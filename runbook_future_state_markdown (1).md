# SRE Runbook Enhancement
## Future State Vision & Implementation Roadmap

---

## 🎯 Our Vision

**Transform our incident response capability by creating integrated Splunk dashboards, app dev-specific runbooks, and enhanced IBM APIM troubleshooting resources that enable faster problem resolution and better team collaboration.**

---

## 🚨 Current State Challenges

- App dev teams receive alerts but lack immediate diagnostic context
- Limited visibility into API-specific performance and error patterns  
- Generic runbooks don't address IBM APIM-specific troubleshooting
- Manual data gathering increases incident response time
- Inconsistent troubleshooting approaches across teams

---

## 🏗️ Future State Components

### 1. 📊 API-Specific Splunk Dashboards

Interactive dashboards providing real-time diagnostic information for each API, automatically linked from alert notifications.

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time error rates and response time trends
- ✅ Request volume and traffic pattern analysis
- ✅ Error code breakdown and failure analysis
- ✅ Dependency health and performance metrics
- ✅ Historical comparison and baseline analysis
- ✅ Automated drill-down capabilities for root cause analysis

### 2. 📚 App Dev Specific Runbooks

Tailored troubleshooting guides designed specifically for application development teams with their tools and perspectives.

**Features:**
- ✅ Application-focused investigation procedures
- ✅ Code and configuration troubleshooting steps
- ✅ Database and backend service analysis
- ✅ Deployment and rollback procedures
- ✅ Performance optimization guidance
- ✅ Clear escalation paths to infrastructure teams

### 3. ⚙️ Enhanced IBM APIM Troubleshooting

Specialized troubleshooting procedures integrated into existing SRE runbooks for IBM API Management platform.

**Features:**
- ✅ DataPower gateway-specific diagnostic procedures
- ✅ APIC catalog and policy troubleshooting
- ✅ SSL/TLS and certificate management guidance
- ✅ Rate limiting and throttling analysis
- ✅ OAuth and authentication troubleshooting
- ✅ Integration with existing Splunk queries and analysis
